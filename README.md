# Intro2NLP
An introductory tutorial on how to do Natural Language Processing using NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) in Python.


**intro2NLP.ipynb:** a Jupyter notebook which shows how to access, clean, and analyze a corpus using the `nltk` library. 

After accessing Jane Austen's Sense and Sensibility on the `nltk.corpus` package, I preprocess the text by e.g. removing stopwords and punctuations, then plot the distribution of word frequency and apply `sentiment analysis` using the `textblob` library. To show how to do sentiment analysis using a classifier, I train a `Naive Bayes classifier` on the `movie_review` dataset available on `nltk.corpus`.
